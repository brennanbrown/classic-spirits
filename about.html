<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>This blog was originally started in 2015 on
    <a href="https://medium.com/brennanbrown">Medium</a>
    called
    <em>Everyday Essays</em>
    after I graduated from high school, after years of telling myself
    <em>&quot;I really wanna start a blog!&quot;</em>
</p>
<p>Since then, I have migrated to WordPress with the name Wander Notebook, (still available to view
    <a href="http://wandernotebook.com/">here</a>) to now self-hosting on GitHub using a bare-bones layout and design I made myself, under the name
    <a href="https://notebook.casa/">Notebook Casa</a>.</p>
<p>With no expertise or formal education, I have written a multitude of posts on various topics over the years. My most frequented topics are happiness, creativity, productivity, and writing itself.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Many people will tell you that the communicative medium of blogging died out many years ago, replaced by more convenient, short-hand modes of interaction and technology.</p>
<p>I am on a quiet, reluctant fight against that. I believe that people should take a step back from the privately-controlled, information-overloaded platforms of social media that have monopolized the internet and instead carve out a piece of digital real estate for themselves.</p>
<p>Although the age of (poorly designed) Geocities and Livejournal are over, people still have a unique voice that should thrive independently, and not rely on the handful of websites that everyone uses. The Internet is for everyone.</p>
